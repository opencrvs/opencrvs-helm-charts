# General information

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This repository contains Helm charts and development tools for OpenCRVS. For comprehensive documentation, installation guides, and infrastructure setup instructions, please refer to the **[Official OpenCRVS Documentation](https://documentation.opencrvs.org/)**.


## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites for Quick start

<!-- FIXME: Replace with link to official doc once published! -->

* [ ] **Kubernetes**: For macOS and Windows users, we recommend Docker Desktop with Kubernetes, for Linux users, we recommend Minikube. Use one of available solutions:
  * Install [minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start)
  * Enable kubernetes on Docker Desktop, [Learn more](https://www.docker.com/)
  * Any other available kubernetes engine, e/g OrbStack
* [ ] **kubectl**: Install kubectl, Kubernetes command-line tool, check [here](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/)
* [ ] **helm**: Install [helm](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/). Helm is a template engine for managing Kubernetes manifests.
* [ ] **tilt**: Install [tilt](https://docs.tilt.dev/install.html)

### Quick Start with Tilt

> [!NOTE]
> Apple Silicon and ARM64 device owners, please check existing ARM64 tags at [GitHub packages](https://github.com/orgs/opencrvs/packages?ecosystem=container) or build images yourself and update `Tiltfile` before running `tilt up`.

> [!NOTE]
> First time environment startup time may differ depending on your hardware specification and internet connection speed:
> - 20 minutes at 1000Mb/s
> - 15 minutes at 300Mb/s
>
> Every next startup takes up to 5 minutes

1. The fastest way to get OpenCRVS running locally:
    ```bash
    # Clone the repository
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/opencrvs-helm-charts.git
    cd opencrvs-helm-charts

    # Start the development environment
    tilt up
    ```
2. Open the Tilt UI in your browser
3. Navigate to http://localhost:10350
4. Scroll to **"2.Data-tasks"** and run `data-seed` job
5. Navigate to http://opencrvs.localhost

Please also check the [OpenCRVS helm chart](./charts/opencrvs-services/README.md#-quickstart) Quick Start documentation for how to deploy without `tilt`.

For comprehensive guides on OpenCRVS development setup, infrastructure configuration, and deployment options, please refer to the **[Official Documentation](https://documentation.opencrvs.org/)**.


## Repository Content

#### `charts/`
Contains Helm charts for deploying OpenCRVS and its dependencies on Kubernetes. Each chart is a self-contained package with its own `README.md`, `values.yaml`, and templates. These charts define the complete application stack including microservices, databases, backup and restore workflows, and supporting observability solutions based on the ELK stack.

#### `examples/`
Provides ready-to-use example configurations for local deployment scenarios. Each example includes custom `values.yaml` files demonstrating best practices for specific use cases. Use these as starting points for your own deployments.

#### `tilt/`
Houses Tilt-specific helper scripts, extensions, and configuration modules used by the main `Tiltfile`. These scripts automate common development tasks such as managing Kubernetes resources, OpenCRVS configuration, data cleanup, and seeding.

#### `Tiltfile`
The main entry point for Tilt-based local development. This file orchestrates the entire local development environment, defining how services are built and deployed. Running `tilt up` uses this file to spin up the complete OpenCRVS stack locally.

# Development environment setup

Kubernetes is the easiest option to run OpenCRVS locally on your PC or Laptop and test all features and functionality.
Before running make sure all hardware and software requirements are met.

Once you make sure your development environment is ready for running OpenCRVS we are recommending you start from "For OpenCRVS DevOps" configuration and get familiar with all tools used to deploy OpenCRVS locally (tilt, kubectl, helm). In that particular configuration all docker images are pulled from our registry and OpenCRVS application is starting with Falajaland demo data. No additional actions are needed from your side.


The OpenCRVS team uses [Tilt](https://tilt.dev/) to manage the local development environment. Depending on your role and development needs, the following configurations (Tiltfiles) are available:

- [DevOps developers](#for-opencrvs-devops), This basic configuration is designed for Helm chart development. Tilt uses official OpenCRVS release images along with the Farajaland demo data. Docker images are pulled from the OpenCRVS container registry.
- [Country config developers](#for-opencrvs-country-config-developers), In this setup, OpenCRVS Core images are pulled from the OpenCRVS container registry. The Country Config image is built locally using Tilt's live update feature, so your code changes are reflected almost immediately. Typically, you’ll be working with your own fork of the Country Config repository.
- [Core developers](#for-opencrvs-core-developers), This configuration builds OpenCRVS Core images locally with live updates enabled, allowing near-instant reflection of code changes. By default, the Country Config image is pulled from the OpenCRVS container registry. If you maintain your own fork of the Country Config repository and container registry, you should update the Tiltfile to use your own registry.

### Hardware requirements
- 16G RAM
- 8 CPU (at least Intel 8th generation)
- 100G free storage space

### Software requirements

| Tool       | Description |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| Kubernetes | For macOS and Windows users, we recommend Docker Desktop with Kubernetes, [Learn more](https://www.docker.com/); for Linux users, we recommend Minikube, [Learn more](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start). More information about setting up Kubernetes can be found in the [Docker engine with Kubernetes cluster](#docker-engine-with-kubernetes-cluster) section. |
| kubectl    | Kubernetes command-line tool. [Documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/). |
| helm       | Helm, a template engine for managing Kubernetes manifests. [Learn more](https://helm.sh/). |

**NOTE:**
- This guide does not cover the installation of these prerequisites.
- OpenCRVS team has limited capacity to test different configurations. Feel free to submit an issue on GitHub if something doesn't work in your hardware or software setup.

### Docker engine and Kubernetes cluster

#### Minikube

Minikube (with docker driver) is recommended way to run Kubernetes. However docker engine is still required for Tilt. Please check official documentation on https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/.

**NOTE**: 
- Docker support is still experimental for minikube, but it gives better performance in comparison to alternative solutions.

Add following values to /etc/sysctl.conf for linux (Ubuntu) users:
```
fs.inotify.max_user_instances = 8192
fs.inotify.max_user_watches = 65536
```
If you already have minikube cluster running, please recreate it (delete/start) to apply changes properly/

Start minikube with unlimited amount of memory:
```bash
minikube start --cpus=8 --memory=12g --ports=80:30080
```

- `--cpus`: Number of CPUs allocated to Kubernetes. Use "max" to use the maximum number of CPUs
- `--memory`: Amount of RAM to allocate to Kubernetes (format: <number>[<unit>], where unit = b, k, m or g).
- `--ports`: List of ports that should be exposed (docker and podman driver only)


---

**NOTE:** Any other Kubernetes solution for desktop should work as well. Please check to LoadBalancer and kubernetes services setup if you are not able to access service.

#### Docker Desktop (with Kubernetes enabled)

> [!WARNING]
> Docker Desktop with Kubernetes enabled has higher hardware requirements for RAM in comparison to Minikube

Docker desktop with Kubernetes enabled is recommended for development environment on MacOS and Windows. Get more details how to install docker desktop on official website https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/.

Additional configuration for Docker desktop:
  - Enable host networking to be able access http://opencrvs.localhost, otherwise you will need to configure additional tools like proxy.
  - Enable Kubernetes and configure kubectl with correct context
  - Ensure docker-desktop is configured to use at least 16G or more RAM
  - Ensure Storage is set up at least 100G
